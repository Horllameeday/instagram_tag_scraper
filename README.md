# instagram_tag_scraper

This is a web scraper bot that automates download images from Instagram based on #tags.

The bot opens up the browser (Chrome) using the webdriver and a chromedriver path you will download and provide.
It then logs into instagram using log in details you will provide.
The bot then searches for the #tag you have provided, scrolls down a little and scraps all the images it can find. 
It creates a folder and downloads the images into the folder.
